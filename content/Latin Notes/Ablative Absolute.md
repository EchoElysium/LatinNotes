The Ablative Absolute is "loosely connected" and is a dependent clause.

To identify an ablative absolute you should look for two things:

1. A noun in the [[Ablative]] case
2. A [[Participle]] in the [[Ablative]] case

When translating an ablative absolute you should:

1. Always add "with" because you won't see "cum"
2. If there is no participle translate with "as"
