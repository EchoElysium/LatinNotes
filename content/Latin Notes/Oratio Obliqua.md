Oratio Obliqua is means "indirect speech".
Indirect speech is a second hand report. It is someone's observation of another person.

In an indirect sentence you will find:

1. A head verb - which is an action you do with your mind
2. A subjective accusative - which is a word with an accusative ending that acts like nominative  
3. A [[Infinitive]]

The subject accusative is the the accusative closest to the head verb.

Example:

Dicunt eum amare eam
They say he loves the her.

Dicunt - head verb
eum - subject accusative
amare - Infinitive - when translating you do not need "to" 
eam - subject
